VoltBTC Project Overview
=======================

1. What is VoltBTC?
-------------------
VoltBTC is a website and app that helps you grow your Bitcoin (WBTC) using the latest technology called DeFi (Decentralized Finance). It runs on Starknet, which is a fast, low-fee blockchain built on top of Ethereum.

2. What is DeFi?
----------------
DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It means you can use financial services (like saving, earning interest, or trading) without a bank. Everything happens with code (smart contracts) on the blockchain, so it’s open and transparent.

3. What is WBTC?
----------------
WBTC means "Wrapped Bitcoin." It’s a special version of Bitcoin that works on Ethereum and Starknet. 1 WBTC = 1 BTC, but you can use it in DeFi apps like VoltBTC.

4. What is a Vault?
-------------------
A vault is like a smart, automated savings account. You put your WBTC in, and the vault uses different strategies to help you earn more WBTC over time. You can take your money out whenever you want.

5. Why Use VoltBTC?
